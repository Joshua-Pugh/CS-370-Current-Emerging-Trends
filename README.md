# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project, I developed a deep Q-learning algorithm for an intelligent pirate agent in a treasure hunt game. The starter code provided included basic game mechanics, environment setup, and functions for handling actions and game states. I created the core algorithm, which involved implementing the training loop, action selection strategy, experience replay, and neural network training to enable the pirate to navigate the game effectively and find the treasure before the player.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Throughout this course, I learned that computer scientists design algorithms and systems to solve complex problems, optimize processes, and create software that enhances various aspects of daily life. This work is crucial as it drives technological advancement, improves efficiency, and addresses societal challenges.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into manageable components, identifying key requirements, and applying relevant algorithms and data structures. I iterate on solutions through testing, refining my approach based on feedback and results. This systematic methodology helps ensure that the solutions I create are robust and effective.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the technology I develop is reliable, user-friendly, and promotes fair gameplay. I must be transparent about the limitations of the AI and avoid creating experiences that may frustrate or mislead users. Additionally, I have a responsibility to protect user data and privacy, ensuring that my work aligns with the organization's values and ethical standards. Balancing innovation with these ethical considerations is essential for fostering trust and enhancing user experience.
